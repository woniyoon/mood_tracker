## Introduction
- This is a small project written in React Native.
- We're inspired by a mood tracker on paper from Pinterest and made a decision to make it happen on mobile devices.
- 'Mood & Colors' is our concept, stem from our belief that colors represent and affect our many diffrenet kinds of emotions.
- We're 2 fresh developers without a designer, tried our best on both ui/ux design and implementation.
- Now it's available to download on Android devices only, here is the link!

- XD for design


## Conclusion
- It is definitely my one and only experience to publish the very first mobile application in my life! As opposed to our anticipation, We stumbled and fell into the desperation countless times and it took more time than we thought. But I can say that we've learned a lot especially when it comes to project management. Hopefully we were able to learn React Native and concept of using state management as well, which will help us in doing another React Native project in the future!
